Backstory
- Why I chose this game
Initially wasn’t sure.
I was thinking a different game ..

I’ve always wanted to learn how to play Craps but it’s something you don’t really do. Going out of your way to learn a game like this but since this opportunity presented itself, I’ve decided to go for it.

- I decided to do this game on Monday and I barely finished on time
- Now I can teach you guys so you can go out and play as well!
- I’m definitely not getting the comment well organized code comment


a couple of things that helped me is that 
	Creating a project time line ——
		happy to say I was able to gauge my expectations / time line
	Proof of Concept — —


and the code in itself is unimpressive - I had to brute force code vomit
and I hope you’ll understand why soon:

Trader Joe’s store front
Trader Joe’s garbage


***
Extra MD notes keeping track of work




***
I wish I chose a simpler project
So I can explore JS more
Rather than spend a lot of time working on game moves





What I’ve Learned
****

prepared me for trivial/ tedious debugging that I expect I have to do in the future.
Glimpse into how optimizing and scaling this game with more features and how tedious it can be. 

Got more comfortable using CSS even though it’s not something I really care too much to learn
